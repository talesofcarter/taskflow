## Responsive Design

TaskFlow is designed to be fully responsive:

1. **Mobile (≤600px)**: Single-column layouts for features, reviews, and pricing; accordion for footer links; smaller typography and icons.

2. **Tablet (601px–900px)**: Two-column grid for features and pricing; two-column footer layout; adjusted spacing and typography.

3. **Desktop (>900px)**: Multi-column grids for features, reviews, and pricing; four-column footer; larger typography and spacing.

4. Uses CSS Grid, Flexbox, and clamp() for fluid typography and sizing.

5. Tested across modern browsers for consistent rendering.

## Accessibility

TaskFlow incorporates accessibility best practices:

1. Semantic HTML5 with <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer> tags.

2. ARIA attributes (aria-label, aria-labelledby, role) for screen reader support.

3. Descriptive alt text for images (e.g., portraits, logos, checkmarks).aria-hidden="true" for decorative icons (e.g., social media).

4. High-contrast colors and hover/focus states for interactive elements.

5. Respects prefers-reduced-motion for animations and transitions.
